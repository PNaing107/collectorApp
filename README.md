## iO Academy Project 2 -  Collector App

Task is to build a collection app based on a chosen theme. The app must display information from a MySQL database and allow users to add additional items to the database.

The technologies I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL
- PHP 7.4
- Unit Testing using PHP Unit

### User Story 1 - See Collection

**As a:** collector
**I want:** to be able to see stored information about my collection
**So that:** I can show off to my friends

### User Story 2 - Add new item to Collection

**As a:** collector
**I want:** to be able to add new items to my collection
**So that:** I can expand my collection

## Project Setup

To replicate this App please create a MySQL database called "epic-rides". Then create the tables for this database and insert initial data by running the SQL commands in CreateInitialTables.sql.

You can then go to index.php on your localhost.
