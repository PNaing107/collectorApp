        <h3>Effort Level</h3>
        <p>This number is based on a scale of 1 to 5.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 represents very minimal physical exertion (i.e. you should not get out of breath).</li>
                <li>2 represents minimal physical exertion (i.e. occasionally you could get out of breath).</li>
                <li>3 represents aerobic physical exertion (i.e. you should get out of breath but still be able to hold short conversations).</li>
                <li>4 represents high physical exertion (i.e. you should get out of breath and struggle to hold short conversations).</li>
                <li>5 represents very high physical exertion. You should not attempt this unless you are in a trained state without any illnesses/injuries.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Adrenaline Rating</h3>
        <p>This is a subjective number based on a scale of 1 to 5. Where 1 represents a route that is not intended to be scary
            and 5 represents something only for the thrillseekers (i.e. expect high speeds and regular "Oh Shit!" moments )
